// ## Phrasing?

// - Are you coming?

// - Something, something, danger zone, I know I'm not even trying any more

// - I like your spunk

// - I'm coming for you

// ## That's how you get ants

// - Is that what you want? Because that's how you get ants

// ## Danger zone

// - It will be dangerous. Would you say that we would be entering into a 'zone' of danger?

// ## Rampage

// - RAMPAGE!

// ## Just the tip
